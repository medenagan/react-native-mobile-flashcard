# react-native-mobile-flashcard

A React Native app for iOS and Android.

Machine requirements: nodejs, npm, Expo (Linux / Mac / Windows)

https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started

Optional Requirements:

Android Emulator needs the Android Studio core. It can on all platforms.
iOS Simulator needs Xcode. It can run only on Mac

Expo allows running and testing the app on a physical without the need of any e/simulator, though.

Installing npm dependencies

`npm install`

Running

`npm start`

Know Issues:
React-redux was downgraded to 5.1.1 as the newest versions require React 16.8.4+
Currently expo autoinstalls React 16.5.0 and any attempt to upgrade it manually has
broken something
